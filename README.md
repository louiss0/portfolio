# Shelton's Web: Portfolio

This website is a site that uses Astro as is static site generator. The point of this site is to show off my projects and
my resume. I use vue as my framework of choice. This site has information about all of the projects I have written. How I did them and What they do.

## The Stack

Since this project is small I decided not to configure vue but just rely on it and vue use to control the app.
I use tailwind to make sure that all of the things are styled. I use a concept called utility class layering to style
everything. I tweaked the Astro HeaderLink to become a vue file. And the Nav as well. I installed two libraries that I created called `astro-gap` and `astro-template-outlet`.

Astro Gap is a library that allows you to add space in between elements in astro files. Astro Template Outlet is a library that is used to render
templates inside of Astro files. I decided to self host by using `@fontsource`. I use Lato and Raleway for this one. I use a library called `@vueuse/core` to get some nice functionality.
